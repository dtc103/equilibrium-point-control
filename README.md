## Abstract  
Finding equilibrium points makes it possible to control posture and movement, without
the need of solving the inverse dynamic problem. They can then be used to simulate
movement of healthy, as well as impaired biomechanical systems accurately. Not being
limited by complexity or dimensionality is desirable for methods to find them, in order to
achieve the most accurate results, also in complex environments. In this work, different
methods for finding equilibrium points are investigated and applied to musculoskeletal
models of increasing complexity, using the open source simulation software OpenSim. In
sum, our results show that it is possible to find equilibrium points in multi-joint systems,
without having to solve the inverse dynamics problem in a reasonable runtime, while
still getting acceptable accuracy.
